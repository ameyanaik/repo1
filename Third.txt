This is my Third file in GIT repository

Unless I commit to a branch, GIT will not register it as a change. 


Want to access in master.


To get the latest changes from the remote repository / which can also be called as the central repository or common server - In our case it is GITHUB, but it could be a local machine or some other service like GITHUB.

1. Click on Fetch 'origin' 
	(Origin here is the name of the repository on github. By default it is named as origin, but you can change it if you want)

Fetch tells you whether there are any changes available by only fetching the history not the actual content

2. Click on Pull origin

Pull downloads the actual content and merges it with your local repository
